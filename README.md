# CI-Lisp
A project for Comp 232 at CSUCI

Hello! Welcome to my CI Lisp Project!

This may take a while to complete. Updates and code will be posted here.

12.6.18

Currently working on Task 2. The code has finally been uploaded on here. Does it compile? Sort of. Does it do what it is supposed to?
No, not really.


12.8.18

Task 2: updated symbol_node to allow doubles and altered symbol function to accompany this change.

12.11.18

Still on task 2. Compiles once again after a long time of not compiling. Recognizes symbols, but still has its own errors. 

12.12.18 Midnight:
I may have finished this assignment for the semester, but I haven't finished it in my heart!
